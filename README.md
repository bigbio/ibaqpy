iBAQ (intensity Based Absolute Quantification) determines the abundance of a protein by dividing the total precursor intensities by the number of theoretically observable peptides of the protein. The TPA (Total Protein Approach) value is determined by summing peptide intensities of each protein and then dividing by the molecular mass to determine the relative concentration of each protein. By using [ProteomicRuler](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620337749), it is possible to calculate the protein copy number and absolute concentration. **ibaqpy** compute IBAQ values, TPA values, copy numbers and concentration for proteins starting from a feature parquet from [quantmsio](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms.io) and a [SDRF](https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata) file. In addition, it supports the merging of iBAQ results from multiple datasets and the elimination of outliers and batch effects. This package provides multiple functions: 

**Assemble features as peptides**: In features, the differences between different runs and different fractions in the sample were reduced, and then normalized after combining into peptides. See details in `commands/features2peptides`.

**Assemble peptides as proteins**: In the sample, the protein was combined from its unique peptides, then the iBAQ value was calculated as the Intensity of the protein devided by the theoretical number of unique peptides cut by the enzyme. This command also normalized iBAQ as riBAQ. See details in `commands/peptides2proteins`.

**Compute TPA**: Compute TPA values, protein copy numbers and concentration from the output file from script `commands/features2peptides`. See details in `commands/compute_tpa.py`.

**Merge projects**: Merge ibaq results from multiple datasets. It consists of three steps: missing value imputation, outlier removal, and batch effect removal. See details in `commands/datasets_merger.py`.

**NOTE:** In all scripts and result files, *uniprot accession* is used as the protein identifier.

Peptide normalization starts from the peptides dataframe extracted from feature parquet. It contains the following columns:

- ProteinName: Protein name
- PeptideSequence: Peptide sequence including post-translation modifications `(e.g. .(Acetyl)ASPDWGYDDKN(Deamidated)GPEQWSK)`
- PrecursorCharge: Precursor charge
- FragmentIon: Fragment ion
- ProductCharge: Product charge
- IsotopeLabelType: Isotope label type
- Condition: Condition label `(e.g. heart)`
- BioReplicate: Biological replicate index `(e.g. 1)`
- Run: Run index `(e.g. 1)`
- Fraction: Fraction index `(e.g. 1)`
- Intensity: Peptide intensity
- Reference: Name of the RAW file containing the peptide intensity `(e.g. Adult_Heart_Gel_Elite_54_f16)`
- SampleID: Sample ID `(e.g. PXD003947-Sample-3)`
- StudyID: Study ID `(e.g. PXD003947)`. In most of the cases the study ID is the same as the ProteomeXchange ID.

#### 1. Data preprocessing

In this section, ibaqpy will do: 
- Remove lines where intensity or study condition is empty
- Parse the identifier of proteins and retain only unique peptides
- Low confidence proteins were removed according to the threshold of unique peptides (optional)
- Filter decoy, contaminants, entrapments, and user-specified proteins (optional)
- Remove peptides with low frequency if `sample number > 1` (optional)
- Data logization (optional)

#### 2. Feature normalization

In this section, ibaqpy corrects the intensity of each MS runs in the sample, eliminating the effect between runs (including technique repetitions). It will do:

- When `MS runs > 1` in the sample, the `mean` of all average(`mean`, `median` or `iqr`) in each MS run is calculated(SampleMean)
- The ratio between SampleMean and the average MS run is used as reference to scale the original intensity

#### 3. Assembly features to peptides

A peptidoform is a combination of a `PeptideSequence(Modifications) + Charge + BioReplicate + Fraction`, and a peptide is a combination of a `PeptideSequence(Canonical) + BioReplicate`. ibaqpy will do:

- Select peptidoforms with the highest intensity across different modifications, fractions, and technical repeats
- Merge peptidoforms across different charges and combined into peptides

#### 4. Peptide Intensity Normalization

Finally, the intensity of the peptide was normalized globally by `globalMedian`,`conditionMedian`.


### Compute IBAQ
IBAQ is an absolute quantitative method based on strength that can be used to estimate the relative abundance of proteins in a sample. IBAQ value is the total intensity of a protein divided by the number of theoretical peptides.

```asciidoc
python commands/peptides2proteins.py --fasta tests/PXD003947/Homo-sapiens-uniprot-reviewed-contaminants-decoy-202210.fasta --peptides tests/PXD003947/PXD003947-peptides-norm.csv --enzyme Trypsin --output tests/PXD003947/PXD003947-ibaq-norm.csv --normalize --verbose
``` 

The command provides an additional `flag` for normalize IBAQ values.

#### 1. Performs the Enzymatic Digestion
The current version of this tool uses OpenMS method to load fasta file, and use [ProteaseDigestion](https://openms.de/current_doxygen/html/classOpenMS_1_1ProteaseDigestion.html) to enzyme digestion of protein sequences, and finally get the theoretical peptide number of each protein.

#### 2. Calculate the IBAQ Value
First, peptide intensity dataframe was grouped according to protein name, sample name and condition. The protein intensity of each group was summed. Finally, the sum of the intensity of the protein is divided by the number of theoretical peptides.

If protein-group exists in the peptide intensity dataframe, the intensity of all proteins in the protein-group is summed based on the above steps, and then multiplied by the number of proteins in the protein-group.

#### 3. IBAQ Normalization  
Normalize the ibaq values using the total ibaq of the sample. The resulted ibaq values are then multiplied by 100'000'000 (PRIDE database noramalization), for the ibaq ppb and log10 shifted by 10 (ProteomicsDB).

### Compute TPA
The total protein approach (TPA) is a label- and standard-free method for absolute protein quantitation of proteins using large-scale proteomic data. In the current version of the tool, the TPA value is the total intensity of the protein divided by its theoretical molecular mass.

[ProteomicRuler](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4256500/) is a method for protein copy number and concentration estimation that does not require the use of isotope labeled standards. It uses the mass spectrum signal of histones as a "proteomic ruler" because it is proportional to the amount of DNA in the sample, which in turn depends on cell count. Thus, this approach can add an absolute scale to the mass spectrometry readout and allow estimates of the copy number of individual proteins in each cell.

#### 1. Calculate the TPA Value
The OpenMS tool was used to calculate the theoretical molecular mass of each protein. Similar to the calculation of IBAQ, the TPA value of protein-group was the sum of its intensity divided by the sum of the theoretical molecular mass.

#### 2. Calculate the Cellular Protein Copy Number and Concentration
The protein copy calculation follows the following formula:
```
protein copies per cell = protein MS-signal *  (avogadro / molecular mass) * (DNA mass / histone MS-signal)
```
For cellular protein copy number calculation, the uniprot accession of histones were obtained from species first, and the molecular mass of DNA was calculated. Then the dataframe was grouped according to different conditions, and the copy number, molar number and mass of proteins were calculated.

In the calculation of protein concentration, the volume is calculated according to the cell protein concentration first, and then the protein mass is divided by the volume to calculate the intracellular protein concentration.

### Datasets Merge
There are batch effects in protein identification and quantitative results between different studies, which may be caused by differences in experimental techniques, conditional methods, data analysis, etc. Here we provide a method to apply batch effect correction.  First to impute ibaq data, then remove outliers using `hdbscan`, and apply batch effect correction using `pycombat`.

#### 1. Impute Missing Values
Remove proteins missing more than 30% of all samples. Users can keep tissue parts interested, and data will be converted to a expression matrix (samples as columns, proteins as rows), then missing values will be imputed with `KNNImputer`. 

#### 2. Remove Outliers
When outliers are removed, multiple hierarchical clustering is performed using `hdbscan.HDBSCAN`, where outliers are labeled -1 in the PCA plot. When clustering is performed, the default cluster minimum value and the minimum number of neighbors of the core point are the minimum number of samples in all datasets.

*Users can skip this step and do outliers removal manually.*

#### 3. Batch Effect Correction
Using `pycombat` for batch effect correction, and batch is set to `datasets` (refers specifically to PXD ids) and the covariate should be `tissue_part`.
